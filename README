Scope Facade

A simple ColdFusion facade to abstract a shared scope (session, application, server, request).

Useful in applications where you do not want to directly access the shared scope from services.

call init() with the name of the scope you want to abstract.  you can also use subkeys of a scope.
 examples:
 	init("session");  // this would abstract the entire session scope
 	init("session.userinfo"); // this would abstract only the "userinfo" key of the session scope;

You can abstract the Application, Session, Server, or Request scopes.

I have included a cfscript version as well as a tag based version.
